            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>

            <li>50 dumpling wrappers</li>
            <li>½ cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>Procedure:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare dipping sauce: Combine soy sauce, rice vinegar, chives, 
            sesame seeds, and chile sauce in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare dumplings: Mix pork, garlic, egg, chives, soy sauce, sesame 
            oil, and ginger in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Place a dumpling wrapper on a lightly floured work surface and 
            spoon about 1 tablespoon of the filling in the middle. Wet the
            edge with a little water and crimp together forming small pleats
            to seal the dumpling. Repeat to form remaining dumplings.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over 
            medium-high heat. Place 8 to 10 dumplings in the pan and cook 
            until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Pour in 1 cup of water; 
            cover and cook until the dumplings are tender and pork is cooked 
            through, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Repeat to cook remaining dumplings, adding more oil and water for each batch.</li>
        <li>Serve dumplings with dipping sauce.</li>
