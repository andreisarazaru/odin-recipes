        <p>Buffalo wing, also called hot wing, chicken wing, or wing,
        deep-fried unbreaded chicken wings or drumsticks coated with
        a vinegar-and-cayenne-pepper hot sauce mixed with butter. 
        They commonly are served with celery and a blue cheese 
        dipping sauce, which acts as a cooling agent for the mouth.</p>
        <p>Chicken wings are white meat, even though they're juicier
        and have a more concentrated poultry flavor, like dark meat.
        Many people think of Buffalo wings when they think of this 
        part of the chicken, and for good reason: they're extremely 
        popular throughout the United States.</p>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground paprika</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>10 chicken wings</li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>¼ cup hot sauce</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch garlic powder</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Procedure</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together flour, paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Place chicken wings in a single layer in a 9x13-inch glass baking dish. 
                Sprinkle flour mixture over top and toss until wings are evenly coated. 
                Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>Add about 1 inch oil to a deep, heavy skillet; heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
                 (The oil should be just enough to cover wings entirely.)</li>
            <li>While the oil is coming to temperature, combine butter, hot sauce, pepper, and garlic 
                powder in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook and stir until butter is melted and
                 mixture is thoroughly blended. Remove from the heat and reserve for serving.</li>
            <li>Fry coated wings in the hot oil for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they begin to crisp and
                 turn brown. Maintain the oil temperature while cooking.</li>
            <li>Remove wings from the oil and place on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
            <li>Transfer wings to a platter and drizzle hot sauce over top; or mix wings and hot sauce 
                in a bowl until coated. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
