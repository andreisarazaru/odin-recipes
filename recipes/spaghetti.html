        <p>Spaghetti is a popular Italian pasta, often served with a tomato
            sauce sometimes called spaghetti sauce. The Italian word spago 
            means string, and spaghetti is the plural of spago — a description
            of what spaghetti looks like. Spaghetti straps are very thin 
            shoulder straps found on dresses and summery tops. In the late 
            1960s, "spaghetti westerns" were movies about the Wild West, filmed
            in Italy and directed by Italians.</p>
