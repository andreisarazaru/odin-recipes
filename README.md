# odin-recipes
    This is my first project in The Odin Project course and I will be making a recipes website.
        Based on my understanding of the lessons that were taught, I learned about the HTML Boiler
        plate which contains the <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <title>, and <body>. I also learned 
        about the manipulation of texts by using <strong>, <em>, and <h1> to <h6>. The creation of 
        ordered and unordered lists by using <ol> and <li> for ordered lists and <ul> and <li> for 
        unordered lists. And lastly, I know now how to insert images by using <img srs=""> and inserting 
        links with the use of anchors like <a href="">
